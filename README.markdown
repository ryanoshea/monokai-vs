# About This Fork

I've made some adjustments to this theme that I've included as `monokai-2010-normal-ryanoshea.vssettings`.

The original README is copied below.

Monokai for Visual Studio
=========================

Monokai Font and Color setting for Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 with normal and bold variations.

Upon not finding an existing Visual Studio implementation of [Wimer Hazenberg][2]'s excellent [TextMate][5] theme, [Monokai][1], I was certain that either I have strange taste, or the entire .NET development community has no taste.  I'm going with the latter, you chumps.

These vssettings files implement most of the original theme as closely as possible, taking into account that VS does not provide as many contextual elements for syntax coloring as TextMate.  In such cases, the theme tries to adhere to the spirit of Monokai rather than the letter.

Notes
-----
* Using this theme without having [Consolas][3] installed is a waste of time
* This theme was originally designed on an XP box with ClearType enabled.  Depending on your version of Windows/ClearType and your monitor, you may find the bold or normal variants better suit your environment.
* Designed mostly for web work.  Not yet optimized for XAML, etc.  Feel free to improve it!

Installation
------------

Pretty standard:

From Visual Studio, select  Tools > Import and Export Settings and follow the wizard to import either monokai-2010-normal.vssettings or monokai-2010-bold.vssettings

The vssettings files only contain font and color data, but do please back up your settings anyway.
